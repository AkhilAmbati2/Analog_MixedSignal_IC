# Simulation Analysis & Plotting Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts used to post-process circuit simulation
results and visualize LDO and OTA performance metrics.

The scripts read data exported from Cadence (CSV format) and generate plots
for stability, transient response, ripple, and PSRR analysis.
