## Analog & Mixed-Signal IC Design ##

This repository contains my personal IC design work covering
digital, mixed-signal, and analog blocks implemented in advanced CMOS
technologies.

## Scope ##
- Technology nodes: 28 nm FDSOI, 18 nm FinFET
- Tools: Cadence Virtuoso (schematic & layout), Spectre (simulation)
- Verification: DRC, LVS, parasitic extraction
- Design methodology: square-law intuition, gm/ID-based sizing

## Included Designs ##

### Analog
- Single-stage OTA
- Two-Stage Miller OTA
- Low-Dropout Regulators (LDO)
- Bandgap Reference (BGR)

## Digital / Mixed-Signal ##
- Inverter
- NAND / NOR
- SR Latch
- D Flip-Flop
- JK Flip-Flop
- Schmitt Trigger
- Level Shifter

## Design Automation (Python) ##
- Square-law sizing scripts
- gm/ID-based sizing scripts
- Plot generation for design analysis

> ⚠️ Note: No proprietary PDK, model files, or rule decks are included.
