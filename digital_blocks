# Digital Blocks (Transistor-Level)

This folder contains transistor-level implementations of fundamental
digital and sequential logic blocks designed and verified at the schematic level
and layout level.

All circuits are implemented using a full-custom CMOS design methodology
in advanced technology nodes.


## Included Blocks

### Combinational Logic
- CMOS Inverter
- NAND Gate
- NOR Gate
- Schmitt Trigger

### Sequential Logic
- SR Latch
- D Latch
- D Flip-Flop
- JK Flip-Flop

## Design Methodology
- Full-custom transistor-level design
- Noise margin and switching threshold analysis
- Layout-aware design (parasitic-conscious)


## Technology Nodes
- 28 nm FDSOI
- 14 nm FinFET


## Verification
- DC transfer characteristics
- Transient simulations
- Functional verification
- DRC / LVS clean layouts


## Tools Used
- Cadence Virtuoso (schematic & layout)
- Spectre simulator
- PVS for DRC & LVS


## Notes
- Designs are intended for educational and portfolio demonstration.
- No proprietary PDK files or foundry models are included.
- Layout screenshots and simulation plots are provided where applicable.
